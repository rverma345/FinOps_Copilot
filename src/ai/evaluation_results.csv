What is FinOps?,FinOps is a set of practices to manage cloud costs.,"FinOps is a financial operations model specifically designed for managing the cost and efficiency of cloud services. It involves a combination of systems, best practices, and culture to increase an organization's ability to understand cloud costs and make informed decisions. FinOps Analysts and Engineering Managers are typical users who need to identify cost drivers and savings opportunities, and understand their team's spend respectively.",10,1,3
How can we optimize AWS EC2 usage?,"Use rightsizing, reserved instances, and spot instances.","To optimize AWS EC2 usage, you can use the `recommendations.identify_idle_resources(month)` function. This function identifies resources with low usage and provides an estimate of potential monthly savings. It's also recommended to use tagging to categorize resources for better visibility and accurate cost allocation reports.",10,0,3
What is a common FinOps KPI?,"Cost per workload, cost savings, utilization rate.","A common FinOps KPI could be the monthly cost by service or the potential savings from identifying and eliminating idle resources. These KPIs can be computed using the functions `kpis.monthly_cost_by_service(month)` and `recommendations.identify_idle_resources(month)`, respectively.",10,1,3
How do you track cloud spend?,"By using tagging, reporting, and dashboards.","Cloud spend can be tracked by monitoring the usage and cost of each resource. This information is typically provided in the invoice for each month. The invoice includes details such as the invoice month, account ID, subscription, service, resource group, resource ID, region, usage quantity, unit cost, and total cost. This data can be used to calculate various KPIs related to cloud spend.",10,0,3
Best way to reduce S3 costs?,Use lifecycle policies and storage class optimization.,"To reduce S3 costs, you can consider strategies such as deleting unnecessary data, using S3 lifecycle policies to transition data to cheaper storage classes, or using S3 Intelligent-Tiering if your data access patterns change frequently.",10,1,3
What is a reserved instance?,A reserved instance is a pre-paid compute resource offering discount over on-demand pricing.,"A reserved instance is a billing option that allows you to reserve a certain amount of resource capacity for a set period in exchange for a significantly discounted hourly rate compared to on-demand pricing. This option is typically used for predictable, long-running workloads.",10,1,3
How to monitor cost anomalies?,Use cloud provider alerts and anomaly detection dashboards.,"The context does not provide a specific method or function for monitoring cost anomalies. However, it mentions the need for a unified tool to ingest cloud usage data and detect anomalies. You may want to check your data or toolset for specific functions or features that allow for cost anomaly detection.",10,1,3
What is the role of a FinOps team?,"To manage cloud cost, efficiency, and governance.","The role of a FinOps team is to manage and optimize cloud usage and costs. They ingest cloud usage data, detect anomalies, identify savings opportunities, and answer questions in natural language. They also enforce a tagging strategy for better cost visibility and accurate cost allocation reports. They may also terminate or suspend resources that are not in use to save costs.",10,1,3
How to estimate future cloud spend?,"Use historical trends, forecasting, and predictive analytics.","You can estimate future cloud spend by analyzing your past usage and cost data, considering your future plans and growth, and using predictive analytics tools. However, the specific method or function to do this is not provided in the context.",10,0,3
Why is tagging important?,Tagging helps allocate costs and manage resources effectively.,"Tagging is important because it allows for the categorization of resources by attributes such as team, project, or environment. This provides cost visibility and enables accurate cost allocation reports.",10,1,3
