# Product Requirements Document (PRD) - FinOps Copilot

## Problem Statement
Organizations face challenges in managing and optimizing their cloud costs effectively. Cloud bills are large, complex, and not always transparent. Engineering teams lack insights into cost drivers, while finance teams struggle to forecast and allocate budgets. There is a gap in bridging financial accountability with technical decision-making.

## Users
- **FinOps Practitioners**: Need to monitor cost KPIs, identify anomalies, and optimize usage.
- **Engineering Managers**: Want to understand resource usage, cost efficiency, and performance trade-offs.
- **Finance Teams**: Require transparency in cost allocation, budgeting, and forecasting.

## Top Use Cases
1. View cloud cost KPIs (monthly cost, cost per service, anomaly detection).
2. Retrieve AI-driven recommendations for cost optimization (e.g., rightsizing, unused resources).
3. Use natural language queries to ask about cloud spending patterns (powered by RAG).
4. Enable multi-team accountability by analyzing shared data sources.

## Success Metrics
- **Accuracy**: >80% accuracy in answering cost-related questions.
- **Usability**: Average user rating of ≥4/5 in usability tests.
- **Efficiency**: Recommendations reduce at least 10–15% of unnecessary costs in test scenarios.


## Deliverables
- Streamlit-based frontend for interactive dashboards and Q&A.
- FastAPI backend serving KPIs, recommendations, and RAG Q&A.
- ChromaDB vector store for semantic search on FinOps documents.
- Docker Compose setup for reproducible deployment.
