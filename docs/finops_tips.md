# FinOps Tips for Cloud Cost Optimization

## 1. Right-Sizing Resources
Regularly monitor resource utilization (CPU, memory, disk) and downsize instances that are consistently underutilized. This can lead to significant cost savings. Tools like AWS Compute Optimizer and Azure Advisor can help automate this process.

## 2. Identifying Idle Resources
Terminate or suspend resources that are not in use, such as old development servers or unused storage volumes. Even small, seemingly insignificant idle resources can add up to considerable monthly costs.

## 3. Reserved Instances & Savings Plans
For predictable, long-running workloads, consider using Reserved Instances (RIs) or Savings Plans. These offer substantial discounts (up to 72% on AWS) compared to on-demand pricing in exchange for a one- or three-year commitment.

## 4. Storage Lifecycle Policies
Implement data lifecycle policies to automatically move data to cheaper storage tiers (e.g., from hot to cold storage) as it ages. This is particularly effective for large datasets in services like Amazon S3 or Azure Blob Storage.

## 5. Enforce a Tagging Strategy
Use a consistent tagging strategy to categorize resources by team, project, or environment (e.g., `owner:john.doe@example.com`, `env:prod`). This provides cost visibility and enables accurate cost allocation reports.
